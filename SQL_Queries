This repository contains SQL queries used to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. These queries were designed to analyze and visualize key metrics related to loan performance, helping banks make data-driven decisions.

üìå Overview
The project focuses on:

- Tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.
- Segmenting loans into Good Loans and Bad Loans for performance evaluation.
- Building interactive dashboards for summary, trends, and detailed analysis.
